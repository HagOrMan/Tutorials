# Welcome
This repository contains tutorials on things that I wish I knew, had trouble finding information for, or just want for myself in the future since I consider it useful information. Feel free to use any code you see here without citing it, and if you ever see something is out of date or want to add your own tutorials here to help others, check out the [contribution section](#how-you-can-contribute) of this readme!

# List of Tutorials
* [Virtual Environments 101](VirtualEnvironments.md) - Why you would want to use a venv, how to install miniconda, and basic commands

# How you can contribute
Feel free to fork this repository, make your own tutorial/suggest updates to an existing one, and create a pull request. I'll review your changes, and if I accept them, you can now say you've contributed to an open-source project that aims to help others! You'll also get to add yourself to the [contributions doc](Contributions.md) if you'd like, and have everyone know what a helpful person you are.
