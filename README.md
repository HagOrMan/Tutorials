# Welcome
This repository contains tutorials on things that I wish I knew, had trouble finding information for, or just want for myself in the future since I consider it useful information. Feel free to use any code you see here without citing it, and if you ever see something is out of date or want to add your own tutorials here to help others, check out the [contribution section](#how-you-can-contribute) of this readme!

# List of Tutorials
* [Virtual Environments 101](VirtualEnvironments.md) - Why you would want to use a venv, how to install miniconda, and basic commands for conda and python venvs
* [Advanced Terminal Commands](TerminalCommands.md) - Very short file on commands I've needed in the terminal when doing ML work (on co-op so not comprehensive by any means). If you want basic bash scripting, I recommend [this link](https://devhints.io/bash)
* [Bash Aliases](BashAliases.md) - How to begin building your *bash castle*, a fortress of commands to help reduce friction in your work and improve efficiency (because let's be real, who wants to type out the full command when you can use a two or three character alias instead)

# How you can contribute
Feel free to fork this repository, make your own tutorial/suggest updates to an existing one, and create a pull request. I'll review your changes, and if I accept them, you can now say you've contributed to a project that aims to help others! You'll also get to add yourself to the [contributions doc](Contributions.md) if you'd like, and have everyone know what a helpful person you are.
